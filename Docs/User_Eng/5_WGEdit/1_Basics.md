This Documentation assumes you already learned WorldEdit (Tutorials: [Text][WE-Text], [Video][WE-Video]).

WGE is basically an integrated WorldEdit, which is missing a few features and has a few additional ones.

Due to a few (critical) features (like support for `.schem` files) missing and it's poor usability i strongly recommend having another WorldEdit plugin installed.

## Selection

It uses a golden hoe in the same manner as WorldEdit uses a wooden axe.
